Version 1 of my custom SlimeVR cases.

# Disclaimer:

I made these slimes around February 2024. It was my first time working in Fusion 360, and my first time in a while working with CAD modeling software (At least a year). With the help of the SlimeVR community, Youtube, and having the courage to ask some probably very stupid questions, I was able to create some cases that I really loved and finally have Full-Body Tracking.

Because of that, though, I don't recommend printing these cases out without modifying them. I have some better cases that will go up in a repository soon, and I'll be using that repository for any updates made to the design. This repository is here purely as an archive. I made a lot of mistakes making these, but I want to leave them up here to remind myself where I started from. I'll have parts list below, but again, I *strongly* recommend against printing these as is. If you want to take my design and make some modifications to suit your needs, I would love to see them <3

This community and similar ones have been kind of my gateway into DIY culture. I knew about it, but I never really understood how fun it could be until now! If you're still on the fence about building something for yourself, modifying a design, or whatever, this is your sign to give it a shot! The DIY community is ridiculously helpful, and you'll always be in the weeds with other hobby DIYers too. 

# Parts List:
- Note that you'll still need wires, diodes, resistors, electrical tape, etc. The SlimeVR Docs has those parts listed for cheap on Ali [here](https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/components-guide.html). This section is for showing what parts/sizes this case was made to fit.

- **Note:** Out of the 11 ordered only 1 arrived DOA. Always good to order more just in case.
